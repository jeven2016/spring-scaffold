# By default, spring won't merge it with src/resources/application.yml and only the test/resource/applicaion.yml
# take effects in this case. Then some settings defined in src/resources/application.yml would be
# discarded while you run your test code.
# So a new file application-test.yml is created to leverage spring's profile mechanism to active an additional profile,
# that can ensure these profiles are enabled in following order for test:
#   src/resources/application.yml
#   src/resources/application-dev.yml
#   src/resources/application-test.yml
# And the application-test.yml will override other yaml files as mentioned above.
